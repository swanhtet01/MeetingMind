    Alice: Good morning everyone. Let's start with our weekly standup. We have three main topics to cover today.
    Bob: Sure, I completed the user authentication feature and started working on the dashboard. The authentication is now fully functional with JWT tokens.
    Charlie: I finished the API documentation and will begin testing today. I found a few edge cases we need to address.
    Alice: Great progress everyone. Bob, any blockers on the dashboard?
    Bob: No major blockers, but I need design approval for the layout.
    Alice: I'll get that to you by end of day. Charlie, what kind of edge cases?
    Charlie: Mainly around error handling when the API is down or slow.
    Alice: Let's schedule a separate session to discuss those. Any other updates?
    Bob: The deployment pipeline is ready for testing.
    Alice: Perfect. Let's wrap up. Next meeting is same time next week.
